I've been happily running it since. However, some of the major disadvantages of the system cropped up very quickly. The major issue I had was that even with eCryptfs I still had some more private documents that I didn't feel comfortable having decrypted whenever I'm logged into the laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I grabbed my large external harddrive and made a standard encrypted partion. I selected LUKS + ext4.  The major difference between LUKS and eCryptfs is that eCryptfs files are encrypted on their own, whereas LUKS crypto is applied to the entire partition. This is good and bad. eCryptfs likens themselves to PGP in this way, since the files have everything they need to be decrypted separately. So apparently you could migrate files from one machine to the other without them needing to be encrypted for transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating the encrypted partition was dead simple. The GNOME disk utility got me all set up making the partition. Then I just followed the long, slow process of migrating files. However, USB 3.0 made things move pretty quickly...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I can access the disk only when I want to, decrypting it when I need it rather than all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next major interest was identifying how the cipher strength of default LUKS compares with default eCryptfs. So I went off to investigate how to figure out what kind of crypto was being used by each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used some fairly different commands for each. First, let's look at LUKS. Obviously, first make sure you've decrypted your disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;lsblk -f
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is going to give you information about the block devices on the system. Importantly, it'll give you the ID of the LUKS partition. We need this in order to query cryptsetup for information about LUKS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cryptsetup status &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From this, I'm able to see that my LUKS partition is using AES with a 256-bit key size. That's pretty good. It's FIPS 140-2 compliant, which is pretty good if you trust the NSA. Now how about eCryptfs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;mount
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This shows us all the info we need. Much less work... We can see from the mount attributes that we're also using AES. And the key size is 16 &lt;em&gt;bytes&lt;/em&gt;, or 128 bits. So that's AES 128. Not too shabby, but could be better. Initially I misread the keysize as 16 &lt;em&gt;bits&lt;/em&gt; and I was kind of terrified for a moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you get better encryption with LUKS, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; better performance, I believe. When I was moving my stuff into my eCryptfs folder it brought the entire system to a crawl. And since it's going on in the kernel, I couldnt even set a nice value or tune it or anything. Yuck. However I didnt have that issue when moving files to LUKS for some reason, despite it needing to still encrypt the data on the fly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So personally, I now have two levels of secure storage. First, there's the eCryptfs mount on my laptop I use for normal stuff. For more sensitive content that I can afford to have off-box, I use LUKS. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ecryptfs"></category><category term="luks"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="encryption"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="privacy"></category></entry><entry><title>Directory Encryption with eCryptfs</title><link href="https://nekopy.github.io/ecryptfs.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-03-10T21:24:05-08:00</published><author><name>neko.py</name></author><id>tag:nekopy.github.io,2017-03-10:ecryptfs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple nights ago I decided to finally get some encryption up and running with eCryptfs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="eCryptfs Honey Badger Mascot" src="http://ecryptfs.org/img/big-honey-badger.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a buddy who's using GPG to do their encryption, however this wasnt really the right choice for me. The primary issue was that the GPG tools I was looking at tend to just deal with a single file. The recommended way of using GPG on folders is to tar them up and encrypt them. To me this approach is really annoying. I dont want to untar some files whenever I want to use them. So after some further digging I wound up coming across the recommendation of using eCryptfs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eCryptfs is, as the name suggests, actually an encrypted filesystem and abstraction layer. The way it works is by introducing a kernel module which handles mounting the encrypted files on disk, and decrypts/encrypts file I/O on the fly. This way, you never actually have files decrypted on disk. Judging from the files, you can even set it up to work on your swap space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue I have with it right now is that it's &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;. I'm trying to move some very large files, and it's grinding my laptop to a halt. As you might have seen in my other post, my laptop is relatively chunky. However, since this is overhead, I'm gonna give it the benefit of the doubt and finish moving the files to where I want them before I throw in the towel and try something else. But really, it hurt. I would have written this blog post on the 7th but the kernel module brought even vim to a halt. And since its in the kernel, I can't just hop in and set a good nice value...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, to set it up, it's mega simple. You wanna grab ecryptfs-utils from your package repos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, in order to use them I needed to add myself to a new group called ecryptfs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun little trick I learned is that once you're in the group, you can get your system to honor the new group without needing to reboot by using the newgrp command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;newgrp ecrypts
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Good stuff. Now that we're all set there, we wanna use the default eCryptfs setup. You do this like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ecryptfs-setup-private
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is gonna get you all configured with some new juicy ecryptfs space in a folder called .Private in your home directory and it's going to automatically set up a mount which allows you to access the files in a folder called Private when you login. There's two passwords you set up. One is the normal login password. This should match your account password and will be used for decrypting the folder when you mount it at login time. The other is actually to be used for recovery in case your OS dies or whatever. You can recover ecryptfs stuff using ecryptfs-recover-private in case your OS gets fucked or something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my next step was obviously to move all my private goodies like accounting records into my new Private folder. And after that, I obviously wanted to protect myself a little by shredding the files that I'd copied in. But there's a problem. I use ext4, which to my understanding is a journaling filesystem. This means that writes arent all done immediately. However, you can flush the journal buffer with the shell command sync. The shred man page says the following goodies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAUTION: Note that shred relies on a very important assumption: that the file system over‐
 writes data in place.  This is the traditional way to do things, but many modern file sys‐
 tem designs do not satisfy this assumption.  The following are examples of file systems on
 which shred is not effective, or is not guaranteed to be  effective  in  all  file  system
 modes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;log-structured  or  journaled file systems, such as those supplied with AIX and Solaris (and JFS, ReiserFS, XFS, Ext3, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;file systems that write redundant data and carry on even if some writes  fail,  such  as RAID-based file systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;file systems that make snapshots, such as Network Appliance's NFS server&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;file systems that cache in temporary locations, such as NFS version 3 clients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compressed file systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In  the case of ext3 file systems, the above disclaimer applies (and shred is thus of lim‐
 ited effectiveness) only in data=journal mode, which journals file  data  in  addition  to
 just  metadata.   In both the data=ordered (default) and data=writeback modes, shred works
 as usual.  Ext3 journaling modes can be changed by adding the data=something option to the
 mount  options  for  a particular file system in the /etc/fstab file, as documented in the
 mount man page (man mount).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's a lot of internet paranoia on the same subject. However someone out there made a good point... A journaling filesystem will only journal for a little while. We can forcibly flush that using a sync. They proposed the following code which should flush the shred before deleting it. I wrapped it all up nice in a shell function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;jshred&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        shred -v -n &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;
        sync
        shred -v -n &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; -z -u &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is going to nuke the file with random garbage before deleting it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I've never looked back. I'm set up to dual-boot with windows, so I still have my games if need be. However one of the biggest issues I had was the incompatiblity of my internal wireless card with available drivers. Instead, I wound up buying myself a usb wireless adapter, which is a pretty mean motherfucker, but it needed me to build the kernel module from source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With fedora I get very frequent updates to my kernel, however, and this means very frequently I'll boot up and have no internet, because lo and behold, the kernel updated and I need to rebuild my driver. Oh and it doesnt play nice with NetworkManager either. I had to get down and dirty with nm-cli, but that's a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I finally sucked it up and learned how to use DKMS. What DKMS will do (and I always confuse it with DPKG) is automatically rebuild your kernel modules from source when the kernel upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting it up was extremely simple. I followed a simple tutorial, with only slight modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, copy your kernel source to a new folder under /usr/src&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;su
mkdir /usr/src/rtl8814AU-4.3.21
cp -R ~/rtl8814AU/* /usr/src/rtl8814AU-4.3.21
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Where the folder you make is in $(module-name)-$(module-version) format. Then we're gonna add a dkms.conf file at the top level of that folder, and fill it with the appropriate content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;PACKAGE_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;rtl8814AU&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;PACKAGE_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;4.3.21&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;BUILT_MODULE_NAME[0]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;8814au&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;DEST_MODULE_LOCATION[0]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;MAKE[0]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;make -j12&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;AUTOINSTALL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Probably the most interesting thing going on here is the value of the MAKE[0] key. This is the command that's gonna be called when DKMS enters your module directory to build up your stuff. In my case, the makefile already has everything it needs to build itself. (Except for two lines being backwards which broke DKMS building... in an 1800 line Makefile... took hours to isolate and fix). By default, DKMS will want to build your project with as many jobs as you have cores. Obviously, I know better than the DKMS authors, and the magic job number is 1.5 times the number of cores you have. In my case, that gives us -j12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all that's set, just add that sucker to DKMS with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;dkms add -m rtl8814AU -v 4.3.21
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and test building...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;dkms build -m rtl8814AU -v 4.3.21
dkms status
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This includes various topics including programming, reverse engineering, computer miscellany and potentially electronics, depending on which topics I choose to pursue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, I'm a software engineer at a network security company. In my free time I work on game development and occasionally help with the Discord chatbot, Bakabot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I've been working mostly on configuring my pelican theme. At time of writing, I'm using the eevee theme, which is based on Google's material design philosophy. I tend to be a fan of the google material design look and feel but I'm not sure I'm sold on how it looks for a website. It's very... colorful despite being a minimal theme. My favorite colors tend to be mute earthy things and blues, but eevee insists on using non-hex values for the theme colors. I was hoping to emulate the colors of an espeon in order to continue the pokemon thing, but &lt;a href="https://getmdl.io/customize/index.html"&gt;the color picker eevee recommends use of&lt;/a&gt; is fairly limited. For whatever reason, pelican seems to want to use reStructured Text instead of the more common markdown by default, so many of the examples are painfully presented in rST. I expect markdown to continue to be the &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; of rich text markup, so I'm going to stick with that. Plus it's what discord uses, and it's what Atlassian uses, and gamejolt... basically my whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the text markup, most important to me is how well it can do code blocks, of course. Let's give it a shot...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;This should be a python block&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;and a c block&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;And c++...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;endl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those look alright? They better or I'm going to have to move to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, after some quick learning, seems like pelican is lying through its gnarly bird teeth about how to do syntax highlighting in markdown. It's apparently the same as it is in Discord; three backticks, the name of the language, a return, then three more backticks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;print("shit")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like this. Fortunately the &lt;a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/"&gt;WordPress Markdown quick reference&lt;/a&gt; verified for me quickly that it's not just a nuance of discord.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category><category term="blogging"></category></entry></feed>
